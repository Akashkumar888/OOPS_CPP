// ✅ SOLID Principles — Simple Interview Explanation
// S – Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
// A class should have only one reason to change.
// Meaning: One class should do only one job.
// Simple line to say:
// “If a class has more than one responsibility, changes in one may break the other. SRP avoids that.”

// O – Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
// Open for extension, closed for modification.
// Meaning: You should be able to add new features without changing existing code.
// Simple line to say:
// “We extend behavior using inheritance or composition instead of modifying tested code.”

// L – Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)
// Child class must be substitutable for parent class.
// Meaning: Wherever a base class object works, a derived class object should work without breaking logic.
// Simple line to say:
// “A derived class must behave like the base class, without changing expected behavior.”

// I – Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)
// Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they don't use.
// Meaning: Prefer smaller and specific interfaces rather than one large interface.
// Simple line to say:
// “A class should only implement what it actually needs.”

// D – Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)
// High-level modules should depend on abstractions, not concrete classes.
// Meaning: Use interfaces/abstract classes instead of tightly coupling classes.
// Simple line to say:
// “DIP reduces dependency between modules and makes code flexible for changes.”

// ✅ How to present in interview (30–40 seconds)
// “SOLID is a set of five OOP design principles for writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code.
// Single responsibility keeps each class focused.
// Open/Closed allows adding new features without modifying existing classes.
// Liskov substitution ensures derived classes work wherever base classes are used.
// Interface segregation prevents forcing classes to implement unused methods.
// Dependency inversion makes high-level modules depend on abstractions, improving flexibility.”
